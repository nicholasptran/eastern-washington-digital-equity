Eastern Washington Digital Equity
===================================
We created an index to determine which tracts in eastern Washington have **access** to **affordable**
**high-speed** internet. We collected data from the American Community Survey
5-year estimates (acs5), Ookla, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).


Most of the data came from the US Census. The 2021 5 Year ACS were the best source of data for this case - with it being more reliable than the 1 year estimates and only being two years old. We also collected speed data from Ookla and provider data from the FCC.


**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
